  Prototypes are a well known, widely accepted development practice
  but, if not carefully evolved, they can become a little nightmare to
  maintain. This paper presents the experience of a four people agile
  team who successfully grew a prototyped system to a
  full-featured application without any clear transition in the

  simple prototyping goal, evolved through iterations and spikes to a

\section{Introduction}

Prototyping is an activity that most developers have heard about. Fred
Brooks mentioned it in The Mythical Man-Month~\cite{Brooks1975} as one
of the best ways to provide a quick view of a feature to the clients
or users to help them make a choice. Dynamic System Development Method
(DSDM)~\cite{DSDM} is heavily based on prototyping and other agile
methods also adopt many ideas related to this concept, like
spikes~\cite{XP} in the Extreme Programming exploration
phase.

Successful software prototypes look very much like complete features
given a certain execution path. Therefore it is common that the
customers are so satisfied that they want to integrate the prototypes
to the working system and move on. The problem is that prototypes are
frequently created in a ``quick and dirty'' fashion and the result is
not adequate to be incorporated in a full-featured system. Yet it is
quite hard to explain this fact to the stakeholders who usually do not
want to invest any more money in this ``already working'' feature. The
consequence is that they switch priorities, focus developer work
efforts on other parts of the system and leave the rough prototype
lost within the code base. Months or years later, the prototype has
become a part of the system but is filled with bugs, unhandled corner
cases and, frequently, crappy code. Nobody remembers what it was
supposed to do or whether it is really important. Maintainability gets
deeply affected and developers get that natural and unpleasant
I-told-you-so feeling. %TODO trauma?

Developers that have been through the pain of maintaining those dirty
prototypes are no longer enthusiastic to work with prototypes. If they
have to, they make it so that there will be absolutely no way to
integrate the prototype to the existing system by either using a
different platform, language or even creating prototypes in other
medias. That inflexibility can reduce the ability of responding to
changes quickly and therefore harm the clients' interests.

This paper presents how a four-people collocated team managed to start
a prototyping project and evolve it naturally to a full-featured
application.  We have organized this experience report following the
chronological order of the project's evolution. Section
\ref{sec:start} will present the project as it was first introduced to
the development team. Section \ref{sec:working} presents the work
process established by the team to create the software based on
prototypes. After some time, the team felt that the customer needed a
full featured application, we describe this change in Section
\ref{sec:changes}. The following section (Section \ref{sec:adapting})
shows how the team adapted to evolve the prototype to a
production ready application. Finally, Section \ref{sec:nowadays}
presents the current status of the project and Section
\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with a summary of practices that were
useful to go through this experience without much pain.

\section{Starting the project}
\label{sec:start}

Back in March 2008, our company was hired to do some consulting for
one of the largest movie producing companies in Brazil. The client had
a great idea for a software to write movie scripts but had absolutely
no knowledge about software development.  He wanted to mature the idea
and understand how much investment it would take to turn it into
working software in order to establish his business plan. The
company's job at the time was to scout the market, discover
competitors and provide an estimation of the work needed to develop
the client's idea.

For such work, one consultant was assigned to understand what were the
client's needs and desires and two developers were asked to analyze
the existing script writing programs and evaluate the possible
development paths. After about 3 weeks of consulting and studies, the
team handed a deck full of story cards with two estimates each, based
on the use of two possible platforms. The first platform was an
existing open source software with several features and a copy-left
license; the second one was an Eclipse Rich Client
Application\footnote{http://www.eclipse.org/rcp -- Last accessed on 27/02/2010}
developed from scratch using Eclipse's open source framework.

This initial estimation suggested that a four people team dedicating 4
daily work hours to the project would be able to build a working
prototype of each feature described in about nine months of
development using the existing open source software and about one year
using Eclipse's platform. The open source solution had the advantage
to provide full functionality of several other features. For a
complete system, the estimation was well over 2 years of work on the
Eclipse version and about a year and a half for the open source one.

After some discussion, the client opted for the Eclipse based solution
due to the license restriction of the open source one which conflicted
with his business plan. He also chose to develop only a prototype of
the idea since 2 years seemed like a too heavy investment for him
alone.

After the exploration phase, the consulting contract ended and a new
negotiable scope contract~\cite{XP}
with emphasis on development effort was established. This new contract
established a team of 4 developers working with an open scope that would
be negotiated monthly, providing 160 hours of work each month. It
specifically stated that the developers would work on pairs all the
time and that the developed system should have automated tests to the
production code.

% Initial priority of the stories, taken from Paulo's spreadsheet:
% Phase 1 => read TXT / separate and number act, sequence and scenes /
% read and show touch / read and show "thread" (characters) / "vision"
% (script tree) / zoom / add notes (summary) / edit touch and
% "threads" Phase 2 => create script from scratch / edit script text /
% "mundo das fichas" Phase 3 => read RTF / read and export FDR

The features initially presented to the team were grouped by the
client into 3 priority groups. The first group contained all features
most critical to the client, the ones that would allow him to
experiment with his ``big idea''. The second one comprised of some
features already present in most script editors in the market, such as
editing the script text itself. Most features in this second group
were in fact epics. The third group contained only features to read
and export to different file formats, such as those used by competitor
programs.

The project's goal was to create a high visual fidelity prototype with
mostly faked or simplified features from the first group. The client
would use this prototype to present his ideas to investors by October
2008. This meeting would either boost the project's development to a
full featured system if the investors liked the idea or end its
development in case they rejected it.

That was the team's vision of the project when development
begun. A short seven months project whose fate would be decided by its
capacity to impress investors. Therefore, the main goal was to provide
support for the client's demonstration to ensure the project's growth
and success. The next section (Section \ref{sec:working}) describes
how the team organized itself to achieve this goal.

\section{Prototyping phase}
\label{sec:working}

Given the project's objective, the customer always prioritized new
features considering only one specific usage scenario. This meant
that, for most features, there were several cases which the team was
asked \textbf{not} to handle. Regarding the source code, it meant that
no verification or validation was written and the prototype would likely
crash if the user did not behave as expected. We also incorporated
several spikes as permanent solutions and did not handle a fair amount
of exceptions, ignoring errors.

The team knew since the beginning that the client would change his
mind over time. After all, it was partly to better understand his idea
and its applicability that he wanted to build this prototype. This
meant that features would be developed to later be thrown away while
code produced only for a quick spike was going to become part of the
system. Therefore, since the beginning the team invested on design,
automated tests and refactoring, just enough to keep the system
flexible to receive the next changes. The team also made it clear for
the client that some work would need to be done on features after he
accepted them in order to polish the work.

The first few iterations went quite smooth, developing features from
the first phase which involved importing a script in a text-only
format marked with some meta-data and providing a simple way
to manipulate and visualize this data. For these first features, it
was easy to avoid inconsistencies since there were not many business
rules involved.

Meanwhile, the client's demonstration script was evolving as the
prototype did and the team was able to use conditionals as needed to
ignore cases he would not enter in during his presentation to
investors. By October 2008, the main features from the first group
were ready for demonstration, although not finished and polished for
real use. However, by testing and playing with these features, the
client felt that the program lacked an important aspect of script
editing programs, which was the text editor itself. It was an epic
initially included only in the second group of features, but he wanted
to see how the text editor would integrate to allow viewing and
editing of the meta-data he was creating. Therefore, he prioritized
the inclusion of an incipient text editor in the prototype and started
to detail stories related to this editor.

As a result of this discovery, the client did not feel completely confident to
present the software to the investors; even so, he started to make contact with
a few people to schedule a meeting to December 2008. That date became our new
deadline until which all efforts should be focused on making a prototyped text
editor available for the demonstration.

At this point, the pressure for polishing the new features increased
since the project's fate would be decided at the demonstration and it
was close! The customer wanted the team to ignore corner cases, speed
up delivery and ensure the demonstration would run smoothly. The
excitement from the important presentation to other people (only our
one client and us had seen the software so far) was a strong
motivation for the development team to deliver all features the client
had asked for. Yet, despite unit testing and pair programming being
mandatory rules on the team, the general will to quickly deliver the
features decreased the code quality considerably. However, external interference
was about to change a bit the situation. Section \ref{sec:changes} will explain
how the project got affected and what new direction those changes pointed to.

\section{Changing the rules}
\label{sec:changes}

December 2008 came and went without any meeting. The company that the client was
in contact with had just been acquired by another one so any project
presentation was useless until things settled down. This relieved the team of
the pressure of the upcoming deadline and we finally acknowledged the burden of
unhandled technical debt. All members of the development team agreed that the
code was getting complex and the quality was decreasing, which had a negative effect on
productivity and speed. This combined nicely with the client's request for a
more complete text editor, with less mock-ups and simplifications. The first
iteration of 2009 was dedicated entirely to refactoring the prototyped editor we
had so far, and the iterations that followed further developed this editor to
include more business rules.

Although the meeting with investors was mentioned in this period, again it did
not take place. The general feeling the development team had was that the
project was no longer aimed at a simple presentation to investors. It was softly
switching to a more elaborate end-user oriented application. This seemed to be
confirmed by two important and concomitant changes that happened between June
and July 2009.

In that period, the client was asking for a much more complex and full-featured
text editor and, at the same time, was exploring and wanted to develop new
features as an evolution and complement to his previous idea. At this point, the
client started to understand the dilemma that the developers had felt so far.
How to keep a good rhythm of new feature delivery and still cover most use cases
of existing features?

The team estimated that to have an editor with the more complex functionality
expected by the client would take at least three full iterations. He did not
welcome this news, since it would mean that no new features would be added for a
while and he wanted to explore them with the investors' meeting still in mind.
We then decided to investigate other possible solutions to the text editor
instead of just developing from scratch. After some research we discovered an
open source Eclipse Rich Client WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) HTML
editor\footnote{\url{http://onpositive.com/richtext/} -- Last accessed on
20/02/2010}. The editor relies on a reimplementation of Eclipse's
\texttt{StyledText} component which is responsible for rendering text within
Eclipse editors. This project was close enough from the one we needed to
implement, having some of the functionality our client wanted on our
application, and was mostly maintained by one Russian company. So, we suggested
the possibility of outsourcing the development of the underlying text editor
infra-structure to this company, thus enabling us to continue working on the new
features the client wanted. He accepted this idea and this was the first change
that confirmed the shift towards a more full-featured system.

At the same time, the team learned that the client had formed a dramaturgy
experts group to help him better understand how to structure the application,
the existing features and the new ones. The software was now going to have a set
of beta testers and it needed to perform decently to allow the users to suggest
improvements for it. However, the current development approach would not be able
to support this new use of the system. The change had to be clear to the client
so that development efforts would be directed to address this new way of
working.

The evidence of the software's deficiency came quickly from the
dramaturgy study group. They started having trouble with several known and
unknown corner cases, unexpected behaviors and just plain old bugs. The client
recognized this problem and, despite the fact that it would mean new features
delivered more slowly, decided it was time to invest more in usability and user
experience. This was the second change that confirmed the shift in the project's
purpose.

Meanwhile, the development team was concerned with the increasing complexity so
they started to track some data from the source code. The first metrics was the
amount of \texttt{FIXME}, \texttt{TODO} and \texttt{XXX} marks in the code. As
previously mentioned, the development team added those marks everywhere they
felt a corner case or a behavior existed but was not handled. Each mark had a
small comment associated and the kind of the mark determined the criticality of
the problem. Figure \ref{fig:TODOs} shows the evolution of those marks during
the project.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centerline{
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{TODOs.png}
  }
  \caption{Evolution of FIXME, TODO and XXX marks in the source code}
  \label{fig:TODOs}
\end{figure}

It is noticeable that the first data collection of those marks is dated for mid
July 2009. It took the team some time to consider this metric was important
enough to be automatically tracked. To consciously acknowledge that the team
needed to track complexity was step one to adapt to the new direction. The next
section will present other practices that allowed us to handle this shift.

\section{Adapting to the new rules}
\label{sec:adapting}

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centerline{
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{LOCs.png}
  }
  \caption{Evolution of production lines of code and test lines of
    code}
  \label{fig:LOCs}
\end{figure}

While the amount of \texttt{TODO} marks was fairly high, the team
still had to develop new prototyped features and therefore they
accepted to just track it and try to keep it under control. While this
gave the team some idea of code complexity, it did not help in showing
if this complexity was being tamed by tests.

By the beginning of August 2009, the client decided that it was
important for him to be able to see the evolution of the work done by
the Russian team and he decided to have two editors available on the
application. The first one was Eclipse's original one and the second
one was based on the new outsourced component. At this point, a major
code duplication was performed since features were duplicated and the
goal was to eliminate our old editor. The result was a huge increase
in the marks tracked as well as an increase in lines of code and the
team suspected tests were not following. A very simple script was
written to count the lines of production code and test code. Figure
\ref{fig:LOCs} shows how both metrics evolved over time. It starts at
the same date as Figure \ref{fig:TODOs} to facilitate comparisons.

As with the \texttt{TODO} metric, the lines of code showed the team a
little issue regarding testing but it was not addressed
immediately. It was well known that the code was not highly covered
since there were no User Interface (UI) tests and quite a few features
were related to the way data was shown to the user. However, the team
had a feeling that the effort to test the controller and model would
have produced more test than code.

By this time, the customer started to mention the presentation
to the investors again. It had been quite some time in the project now and
he was feeling he had spent enough money and needed some external
investment. Therefore the old investor meeting pressure installed
itself within the team and the deadline was, again, the end of the
year. The goal was to quickly integrate the outsourced component and
tune a few features to the so expected meeting.

By the time the team understood the outcomes of those issues,
the code had reached a critical situation. \texttt{TODO} marks were
amazingly high and distance between tests and code was at its higher
level. The work was being roughly divided in three: fixing bugs,
implementing new features and integrating the outsourced component. By
this time, the team also suffered the loss of a member who was
required in a full time consulting work. The team went from two pairs
to one pair and an extra person and the velocity decreased.

Figure \ref{fig:InstanceOfs} shows yet another complexity tracker
developed by the team. Counting the amount of \texttt{instanceof} Java
reserved word led the team to understand the level of special cases
unfactored in the code. Although Eclipse's framework required a few of
those, some of them were avoidable and the team felt reducing this
number would lead to a more factored code.

\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \centerline{
    \includegraphics[width=120mm]{InstanceOfs.png}
  }
  \caption{Evolution of instanceof in the code }
  \label{fig:InstanceOfs}
\end{figure}

Curiously, as for the two previous metrics, the effect of tracking the
number of \texttt{instanceof} was not immediate. More interestingly
than that, in a short time span, having the metric did not stop it
from getting worse. In the rush to produce the features, the team was
becoming reckless with code quality.  Something had to be done or the
project was going to become impossible to maintain and the client's
demonstration would surely suffer from it.

With three persons working by the end of the year to match a two pairs
velocity and reducing complexity, the team had to calm down, step back
and rethink about agile values. Section \ref{sec:nowadays} presents
the resolutions the team adopted and their impact on the current
version of the system.

\section{Current status}
\label{sec:nowadays}

December arrived and it was time to accept a full integration of the
outsourced component and a throw away of the team's first
solution. Along with this came a serious decrease in \texttt{TODO}
marks, \texttt{instanceof}s and lines of production code as a
considerable duplication was erased. By that time, the team was
largely working with just two persons pairing full time since the
third developers was involved in other projects and hardly managed to
pair.

The team decided it should profit from that fact and decided to
institute a merciless refactoring policy. No matter how small or how
big the refactoring was, it had to be done and it was to be included
as a regular part of each task and not as a separated task. Corner
cases were not to be left unhandled and any unsupported work was to
log its execution to the application error log. The impact of those
policies was fairly clear by the end of the month. All metrics had
improved and more bugs were being listed by the development team.

The month passed and no meeting was scheduled. The famous deadline
was, once again, a myth. With code quality increasing, \texttt{TODO}
marks decreasing, test code improving and bugs being caught by the
development team (instead of the users), the team felt an extra
developer would help increase velocity and so started to train one to
join the team in January. With the insertion of this new member in the
team, some work was performed on another platform which led to the
discovery of a series of platform specific bugs. The general feeling
was that the client was getting ready to wrap up the project since he
was quite happy with the software and was considering he invested too
much already on this idea.

However, in the next meeting, the client presented an officially hired
beta tester that was going to support the team improve the usability
of the system. They also presented the team with a load of new
features and usability improvements that they wanted to have done. The
client also mentioned that he was thinking seriously about dropping
the quest for investors and releasing the product by himself. In order
to do so, bugs needed to be eliminated. Any bugs found immediately
gained the highest priority and should be solved in some way as soon
as possible.

With this new policy, the beta tester started to find problems with the
existing features because some business rules were contradictory. The issues reported
to the customer led him to study and analyze his business model
better and the rules evolved. Thanks to the experience that the client
had accumulated so far in the project, he allowed himself to
experiment with a few solutions until he felt more comfortable with the way
features worked, allowing him to seek consistency, conceptual
integrity and the certainty that other choices were not as good as the
one he had made.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Successful software prototypes need not always be completely thrown
away. This fact comes from the very nature of software and the ability
to easily and quickly merge pieces of code together to produce a
working system using agile methodologies. Agility relies on this fact to allow for incremental
evolution of the system and, therefore, supports that drafts should
grow to complete features.

By embracing that, if your prototypes are successful, they will be
incorporated into the software, but you have to prepare to maintain that
code. It does not mean that prototypes should be developed exactly
as well known complete features. Prototyping should allow you to
explore different solutions and as they survive
the selection process they should be refactored and evolved in a similar fashion to the set-based lean approach~\cite{Poppendieck2009}.

Refactoring, testing and decoupling are essential to allow code
evolution and should be practices that are strongly enforced as the prototype 
starts to transform into a working feature. 
Unhandled exceptions, cases or behaviors should be
documented with tests or some other system that allows for
quick listing and search.

Although prototypes are not first class production code and much of
their value comes from this lower class status, they are likely to
climb the ladder up to working essential features of the system. It
is very important to track this evolution and provide the necessary support
to maintain quality. Even so, do not fear to throw away anything either,
the value provided by prototypes resides deeply in the knowledge they
brought to the customers which means the code is much less valuable
then we give it credit for. In our experience using prototypes to test out different ideas for the same feature proved invaluable, and many accepted prototypes were able to evolve to production code in the application.
